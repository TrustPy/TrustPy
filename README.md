# How Much Can We Really Trust You? Towards Simple, Interpretable Trust Quantification Metrics for Deep Neural Networks

This repository contains an implementation of the trustworthiness methods described in: Wong, A., Wang, X. Y., &amp; Hryniowski, A. (2020). How much can we really trust you? towards simple, interpretable trust quantification metrics for deep neural networks. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.05835.


The code is written on Python, designed to be callable without modifications for any AI/ML application that generates SoftMax probabilities.
